Ferrum Music Player is a pure Rust music player made with [egui](https://github.com/emilk/egui) and [rodio](https://github.com/RustAudio/rodio).
Right now, it's pretty basic, but it will definitely be developed into a full-featured music player.

## What's next

- Playlist
- Tag Editor (using [lofty-rs](https://github.com/Serial-ATA/lofty-rs))
- Look and Feel / Color Themes
- UI Configurations

There's no set schedule for when these features will be implemented.

## What's Not Planned

We don't plan to add online features, but we're open to pull requests.
